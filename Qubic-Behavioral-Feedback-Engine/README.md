Crowdlike is a simulation-first behavioral analytics platform designed to help people and autonomous systems understand how they actually behave — before real money or real-world deployment is involved.

Instead of focusing on markets, prices, or raw performance metrics, Crowdlike analyzes behavior patterns: consistency, strain, decision timing, and outcomes compared to the crowd. The goal is to turn complex behavior into clear, actionable feedback.

The project is built as a multi-mode web application:

- **Simulate** – A pure simulation environment where agents or users generate behavior data and receive feedback, metrics, and trend analysis. No blockchain or payments required.
- **Qubic** – A behavioral analytics mode backed by Qubic network data, used to ground simulations and metrics in crowd-level baselines.
- **Arc** – An agentic commerce mode (currently a stub) intended for future integration with Arc and USDC to support usage-based payments and autonomous workflows.

Crowdlike is designed to be modular and extensible. Core logic, metrics, and state handling are shared across modes, while each mode can be run independently for different hackathons or demos.

This project is early-stage, experimental, and learning-focused, but the long-term vision is to grow Crowdlike into a real product that combines behavioral science, simulation, and modern infrastructure.

Built with Streamlit, Python, and a strong emphasis on clarity, transparency, and future scalability.
